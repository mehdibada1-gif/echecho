# Echoecho

About this project
EchoCho is a community-building app designed to connect and empower local green initiatives. It addresses the fragmentation of sustainability efforts by creating a centralized, digital hub where eco-conscious individuals, groups, and organizations can collaborate.

The app's main feature is a real-time, geo-based map that allows users to discover, join, and create green initiatives happening nearby. This includes everything from urban gardening and tree planting to neighborhood clean-up drives. Users can also track their personal and collective impact on a dashboard, which gamifies contributions with points and badges, motivating continued participation.

By unifying these scattered efforts, EchoCho transforms disconnected, local actions into a powerful, collective movement. It provides a simple, engaging, and measurable way for communities to organize, collaborate, and see the real-world results of their sustainability work. The app not only increases civic engagement but also strengthens local environmental networks, making it easier for everyone to contribute to a greener future.
